He was called the father of computers because of his early projects in mechanical computers,and the difference of the engines, that led him eventually to create electronic designs...His ideas for developing the design came from his Analytic machine, from which he got the idea to build a mechanical computer. Babbage had a broad mind and interest in his work developing computers because of his book the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures in 1832, and succeeded in developing a machinery computer. After nine years, Charles Babbage developed a new machine, in which he developed a computer printer using the Analytical machine and different engines.
