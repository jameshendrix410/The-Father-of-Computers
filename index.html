            <p>Charles Babbage was born in 1791-1871, he was an English mathematician, inventor, and philosopher. He was called the father of computers because of his early projects in mechanical computers,and the difference of the engines, that led him eventually to create electronic designs...His ideas for developing the design came from his Analytic machine, from which he got the idea to build a mechanical computer. Babbage had a broad mind and interest in his work developing computers because of his book the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures in 1832, and succeeded in developing a machinery computer. After nine years, Charles Babbage developed a new machine, in which he developed a computer printer using the Analytical machine and different engines.

<p>Charles Babbage generally was known as "Father of the Computer. He made many important contributions to computer science. First, he designed the Difference Engine, a mechanical calculator that was able to compute complicated mathematical functions automatically. His second and more important invention, though, was the conceptual design of the Analytical Engine, considered to be the first general-purpose programmable computer. The Analytical Engine introduced revolutionary concepts such as memory, an arithmetic logic unit, and programmability using punch cards-elements that find a place in modern computers. Even though his machines were not constructed during his lifetime, it was with his efforts that Babbage provided a ground foundation for further advances in computing. His collaboration with Ada Lovelace, who created the first algorithm on his machine, underlined the importance of software in computer science. The ideas that Babbage developed would continue to influence the development of computers and programming well into the present era.
